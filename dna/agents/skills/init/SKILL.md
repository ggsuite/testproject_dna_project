name: init
description: Initialize a new CLAUDE.md file with codebase documentation. Detects whether the project is an rljson, gg/kidney or other project, asks the user to confirm, and folds the matching guide from `dna/agents/guides/` into the generated CLAUDE.md. Also writes a `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` into `dna/_override/` and includes its content in CLAUDE.md.

# Initialize CLAUDE.md (DNA-aware)

Analyze the current repository and produce a CLAUDE.md tailored to it. In addition to the original `init` behavior, this skill is aware of the **DNA layout** that ships with `gg_dna`-style repos: project-specific guides live under `dna/agents/guides/`, and project-local overrides go into `dna/_override/`.

The end result is one CLAUDE.md at the repo root that combines:

1. The standard `init` analysis (commands, architecture, repo-specific notes).
2. The content of `dna/_override/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` (created by this skill).
3. The matching guide from `dna/agents/guides/` (rljson or gg-kidney).

---

## 1. Detect project type

Inspect the working directory to decide which project type the repo most likely is. Check files in this order — first match wins as the *initial guess*:

- **rljson** — repo looks like an `@rljson/*` package:
  - `package.json` whose `"name"` starts with `@rljson/`, **or**
  - `scripts/create-branch.js`, `scripts/push-branch.js`, `scripts/wait-for-pr.js` exist, **or**
  - `package.json` pins `eslint` to `~9.39.x` and uses `pnpm`.
- **gg/kidney** — repo looks like a Grace-Cloud Dart package:
  - `pubspec.yaml` with a package name starting with `gg_`, `kidney_` or `ds_`, **or**
  - the repo lives next to siblings with those prefixes, **or**
  - `gg`/`kd` workflows are referenced in README/scripts.
- **other** — anything else (generic project).

If none of the signals are conclusive, default to **other**.

## 2. Ask the user to confirm the project type

Use `AskUserQuestion` with the detected type as the first option (labeled `(Recommended)`) and the two alternatives as the other options. Phrase it like:

> Detected project type: **<rljson | gg/kidney | other>**. Load the matching guide from `dna/agents/guides/`?

Options:

- `<detected type> (Recommended)` — load the matching guide.
- The remaining types as alternatives.
- (The `Other` option is added automatically by the tool.)

**Mapping from chosen type to guide file:**

| Chosen type | Guide file to fold into CLAUDE.md |
|---|---|
| `rljson` | `dna/agents/guides/rljson.md` |
| `gg/kidney` | `dna/agents/guides/gg-kidney.md` |
| `other` | `dna/agents/guides/gg-kidney.md` |

If the chosen guide file does not exist in the repo, tell the user, ask whether to continue **without** a guide section, and proceed accordingly. Do not invent guide content.

## 3. Analyze the codebase

Same scope as the original `init` skill:

1. **Commands** that will be commonly used — build, lint, run tests, run a single test, anything specific to this repo.
2. **High-level code architecture and structure** — the "big picture" that requires reading multiple files to understand.

Rules:

- If a `CLAUDE.md` already exists, **suggest improvements** to it instead of overwriting blindly. Surface the diff to the user before writing.
- Do **not** repeat obvious instructions ("write unit tests", "don't commit secrets", "provide helpful error messages").
- Do **not** enumerate every component or file structure that is trivially discoverable.
- Do **not** include generic development practices.
- Pull in important parts of `README.md`, `.cursor/rules/`, `.cursorrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` if present.
- Do **not** invent sections like "Common Development Tasks", "Tips for Development", "Support and Documentation" unless they actually exist in source material you read.

## 4. Write `dna/_override/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`

Create the directory `dna/_override/` inside the target repo if it does not exist, and write a file `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` there.

`PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` contains the **repo-specific** part of the analysis from step 3 — i.e. the parts that are unique to this concrete repository (its commands, its architecture, its conventions). It should NOT contain content from the chosen guide (rljson / gg-kidney) — that comes from `dna/agents/guides/` and is folded in separately.

Suggested structure (omit sections that don't apply):

```markdown
# PROJECT_STRUCTURE

## Commands
…repo-specific build / test / lint / run-single-test commands…

## Architecture
…big-picture overview that requires reading multiple files…

## Repo-specific notes
…anything pulled from README, cursor rules, copilot instructions…
```

Show the proposed content to the user before writing. After writing, mention the absolute path.

## 5. Compose `CLAUDE.md`

Write `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root with this exact ordering:

1. **Required prefix** (verbatim, including the blank line after):

   ```
   # CLAUDE.md

   This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.
   ```

2. **Project structure section** — include the full content of `dna/_override/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` (without its top-level `# PROJECT_STRUCTURE` heading, which becomes a `## Project structure` heading here so the document keeps a single H1).

3. **Guide section** — include the full content of the chosen guide from `dna/agents/guides/` (rljson.md or gg-kidney.md). Put it under a clearly named heading (`## rljson workflow` or `## gg / kidney workflow`). If the guide already starts with its own H1, demote it to H2 so there is still only one H1 in CLAUDE.md.

If the user opted to skip the guide in step 2, simply omit section 3.

If `CLAUDE.md` already exists:

- Diff your proposal against the existing file.
- Show the user what would change and ask for confirmation before writing.
- Preserve any existing content the user added that isn't part of the analysis or the guide — when in doubt, ask.

## 6. Wrap up

Briefly tell the user:

- Absolute path of `CLAUDE.md`.
- Absolute path of `dna/_override/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`.
- Which guide was folded in (or that none was, if skipped).

Do not push, commit, or run any further tooling unless explicitly asked.

---

## Important

- **Never** write `CLAUDE.md` or `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` without showing the proposed content to the user first when an existing file would be overwritten.
- **Never** invent guide content — only fold in what actually exists at `dna/agents/guides/<name>.md`.
- **Never** add generic boilerplate ("use unit tests", "don't commit secrets", etc.) that the original `init` skill explicitly forbids.
- The `dna/_override/` folder is the canonical place for project-local overrides — do not write project-specific notes anywhere else.
